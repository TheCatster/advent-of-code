# Advent of Code
All my solutions through the years of advent to code, mirrored from Sourcehut @thecatster.

There is a shell script included to automatically run all the various languages based on year, day, and language file extension. The script is not designed to accomodate everyone's setup, so look at it before running.

The currently supported languages in the script are:
- C++ (The one I focus most on here)
- Rust (I try to port my C++ solutions to Rust fairly quickly)
- Kotlin (And I do the solutions in Kotlin if I have time)

This is way better than having a half dozen different repos for all this!
