# Advent of Code
This repository contains my solutions for all the years of Advent of Code (that I've done so far).

There is a shell script included to automatically run all the various languages based on year, day, and language file extension. The script is not designed to accomodate everyone's setup, so look at it before running.

The currently supported languages in the script are:
- C
- Rust
- Python
- Go

This is way better than having a half dozen different repos for all this, which is what I did before.
